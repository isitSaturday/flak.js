# Flak.js

Adding a little extra protection for your Backbone.js applications.

## Download

Download the `flak.js` or `flak.min.js` file in the `dist` directory.

## Requirements

You will need to have Backbone.js and all of its dependencies (jQuery and Underscore)
on the page before the Flak library is loaded.

``` html
<script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/underscore.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/backbone.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/flak.min.js"></script>
```

It is probably a good idea to concat all of these files for production anyway, so
keep that in mind.
